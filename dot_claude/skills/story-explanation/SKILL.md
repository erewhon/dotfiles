# Story Explanation Skill

> Use this skill when creating engaging narrative summaries of technical content, research, or complex topics.

## Overview

This skill transforms dry information into compelling narratives. Instead of generic summaries, it uses deep thinking to explore multiple story framings and select the most engaging approach.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:
- User requests a "story explanation" or "narrative summary"
- Content needs to be explained conversationally
- Finding the strongest narrative hook matters
- Technical content needs to be accessible to a broader audience

## The Process

### 1. Extract Core Content
- Identify the main subject and key facts
- Note what makes this interesting or important
- Find the human element or real-world impact

### 2. Explore Narrative Angles
Before writing, consider 5+ different story framings:

**Possible Angles:**
- The Problem/Solution arc
- The Origin Story (how did this come to be?)
- The Comparison (old way vs. new way)
- The Stakes (what happens if we ignore this?)
- The Journey (following someone through the experience)
- The Surprise (counterintuitive finding)
- The Conflict (competing approaches or ideas)
- The Future Vision (where this leads)

### 3. Select Best Framing
Choose the angle that:
- Creates genuine curiosity
- Makes the topic relatable
- Avoids obvious or cliché approaches
- Fits the target audience

### 4. Craft the Narrative

## Output Formats

### 1. Three-Part Narrative (Default)
```
HOOK: [Opening that creates curiosity - 1-2 sentences]

BODY: [The story with key information woven in - 3-5 sentences]

CLOSE: [Landing that reinforces the takeaway - 1-2 sentences]
```

### 2. With Source Links
When sources need attribution:
```
[Narrative with inline source citations as markdown links]

Sources:
- [Source 1](URL)
- [Source 2](URL)
```

### 3. Abridged (Ultra-Concise)
For quick summaries:
```
1. [Key point 1]
2. [Key point 2]
3. [Key point 3]
4. [Key point 4]
5. [So what/takeaway]
```

### 4. Video Script Ready
For content that will be spoken:
```
[Opening hook - designed for the first 5 seconds]

[Context - what the audience needs to know]

[The meat - the actual explanation, conversational]

[Callback to hook - tie it together]

[CTA or transition to next topic]
```

## Voice Guidelines

Content should sound like explaining something to a curious friend:
- Casual and direct
- Genuinely curious
- Natural rhythm and pacing
- No forced enthusiasm

### Avoid
- Journalistic clichés: "game-changer", "paradigm shift", "revolutionary"
- Corporate speak: "leverage", "synergy", "best-in-class"
- Hedging: "might", "could possibly", "it seems"
- Filler: "basically", "actually", "you know"

### Instead Use
- Concrete specifics over vague claims
- Active voice over passive
- "You" and "we" to include the audience
- Analogies that connect to familiar experiences

## Examples

### Bad: Generic Summary
"This article discusses the benefits of containerization technology and how it can improve software deployment processes."

### Good: Story Explanation
"Imagine shipping furniture, but you can only wrap each piece individually. Now imagine inventing the shipping container - suddenly everything travels in one standardized box. That's what Docker did for software. Instead of wrestling with 'it works on my machine', developers package everything their code needs into a container that runs identically everywhere."

### Bad: Dry Technical
"The study found a 47% improvement in processing speed when using the new algorithm."

### Good: Narrative Framing
"For years, this calculation took long enough that engineers would grab coffee while waiting. The new approach finishes before they can stand up. That 47% speed boost translates to real time saved, compounding with every run."

## Integration with Content Creation

This skill feeds directly into:
- Video introductions and hooks
- Blog post openings
- Stream explanations of complex topics
- Social media summaries

When used with the content-creation skill, story explanations provide the narrative backbone that makes technical content engaging.
