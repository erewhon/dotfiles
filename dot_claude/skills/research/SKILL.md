# Research Skill

> Use this skill when gathering information, fact-checking, or conducting multi-source investigations for content creation.

## Overview

This skill provides workflows for thorough research using available web tools, prioritizing accuracy and source diversity.

## Research Modes

### Quick Research (2-3 minutes)
For simple fact-checking or single-topic lookups:
- Use WebSearch for initial query
- Verify with 2-3 sources
- Summarize findings with source links

### Standard Research (5-10 minutes)
For content preparation and topic exploration:
- WebSearch for broad context
- WebFetch for deep-diving specific sources
- Cross-reference multiple perspectives
- Document sources for attribution

### Deep Research (10+ minutes)
For comprehensive topic coverage:
- Multiple search queries from different angles
- Primary sources when available
- Competing viewpoints and critiques
- Historical context and evolution
- Expert opinions and data

## Research Workflow

### 1. Define the Question
Before searching:
- What specific question needs answering?
- What type of source would be most authoritative?
- What's the content format this research supports?

### 2. Execute Search Strategy
```
TOPIC: [Research topic]

PRIMARY QUERIES:
1. [Main search term]
2. [Alternative phrasing]
3. [Related concept]

SOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Official documentation
- Academic/research papers
- Industry expert blogs
- News from reputable outlets
```

### 3. Evaluate Sources
For each source, consider:
- **Authority**: Who wrote this? What are their credentials?
- **Currency**: When was this published? Is it still relevant?
- **Accuracy**: Can claims be verified elsewhere?
- **Purpose**: Is this informational, promotional, or opinion?

### 4. Synthesize Findings

Structure research output as:

```
## Research Summary: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Supporting Evidence
| Claim | Source | Verification |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| [Claim] | [Source] | [Confirmed/Disputed/Unverified] |

### Conflicting Information
- [Source A] says X, but [Source B] says Y

### Gaps & Limitations
- [What couldn't be verified]
- [What needs further research]

### Sources
1. [Title](URL) - [Brief description]
2. [Title](URL) - [Brief description]
```

## Content-Specific Research

### For YouTube Videos
Focus on:
- What's the current conversation around this topic?
- What have other creators covered? What's missing?
- What are the common misconceptions?
- What examples/demos would resonate?

### For Blog Posts
Focus on:
- What's the authoritative technical reference?
- What code examples already exist?
- What are the common pitfalls and solutions?
- What's the historical evolution of this topic?

### For Live Streams
Focus on:
- What questions does the audience commonly ask?
- What are the real-time developments in this space?
- What interactive demos would work?
- What controversies or debates exist?

## Tool Usage

### WebSearch
Use for:
- Initial topic exploration
- Finding recent news and updates
- Discovering multiple perspectives

### WebFetch
Use for:
- Reading full articles
- Extracting specific data from pages
- Accessing documentation

### Best Practices
- Always cite sources in final content
- Prefer primary sources over summaries
- Note the date of information
- Acknowledge when information is uncertain
- Keep a research log for future reference

## Output Integration

Research should feed into:
- Video script fact-checking
- Blog post citations
- Stream preparation notes
- Content calendar planning

Always provide:
1. Direct quotes with attribution
2. Links for further reading
3. Confidence level on claims
4. Suggestions for follow-up research
