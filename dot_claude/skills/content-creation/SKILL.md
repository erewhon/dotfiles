# Content Creation Skill

> Use this skill when helping create YouTube videos, live stream content, or blog posts.

## Overview

This skill provides guidance and workflows for creating engaging content across multiple platforms:
- **YouTube videos** (tutorials, reviews, commentary)
- **Live streams** (coding sessions, Q&A, walkthroughs)
- **Blog posts** (technical articles, opinion pieces, tutorials)

## Content Types & Workflows

### YouTube Video Production

When creating video content, follow this workflow:

1. **Research Phase**
   - Identify target audience and their pain points
   - Research trending topics in the niche
   - Analyze competitor content for gaps
   - Gather reference materials and sources

2. **Script Development**
   - Create compelling hook (first 30 seconds)
   - Structure with clear beginning, middle, end
   - Include calls-to-action at strategic points
   - Write for spoken delivery, not reading

3. **Visual Planning**
   - Outline b-roll and screen recording needs
   - Note timestamp markers for editing
   - Plan thumbnail concepts tied to content
   - Consider chapter markers for longer videos

### Live Stream Content

For live streaming, prepare:

1. **Pre-Stream Checklist**
   - Topic outline with flexible talking points
   - Demo code/projects ready and tested
   - Backup topics if main content runs short
   - Engagement prompts for audience interaction

2. **During Stream**
   - Greet newcomers periodically
   - Summarize context for late joiners
   - React to chat without derailing content
   - Time-box segments to maintain energy

3. **Post-Stream**
   - Identify clip-worthy moments
   - Note topics for follow-up content
   - Collect feedback and questions for future content

### Blog Post Creation

For written content:

1. **Structure**
   - Hook headline that promises value
   - TL;DR or key takeaways upfront
   - Scannable sections with clear headers
   - Code examples with explanation
   - Conclusion with next steps

2. **Technical Writing Style**
   - Direct, conversational tone
   - Explain jargon when first introduced
   - Use concrete examples over abstract concepts
   - Include working code, not just snippets

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

Maintain a consistent voice across content:

- **Conversational**: Write/speak like explaining to a friend
- **Authentic**: Share genuine opinions and experiences
- **Practical**: Focus on actionable takeaways
- **Curious**: Show enthusiasm for learning and exploring
- **Humble**: Acknowledge limitations and alternative approaches

### Avoid

- Clickbait that doesn't deliver
- Jargon without explanation
- Filler phrases ("basically", "you know", "like I said")
- Over-promising or sensationalizing

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works with:
- **research**: For topic and competitor research
- **story-explanation**: For narrative framing of technical concepts
- **prompting**: For optimizing AI-assisted content generation
