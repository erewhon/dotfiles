## Development Workflow

- Use "uv" for Python code and "pnpm" for Javascript
- Use typing for Python
- Use Pydantic for Python
- Use Zod for Typescript
- Use ruff for linting and code formatting
- Use pytest for testing
- Use prettier for code formatting with Typescript
- Do not restore, revert, or remove files without asking first

## Content Creation

I create YouTube videos, live streams, and blog posts about coding and technology.

### Voice & Style
- Conversational and direct - like explaining to a curious friend
- Practical and actionable - focus on what people can use
- Authentic - share genuine opinions and experiences
- Curious - show enthusiasm for learning and exploring

### Avoid
- Clickbait that doesn't deliver
- Jargon without explanation
- Filler phrases ("basically", "you know", "like I said")
- Corporate buzzwords ("leverage", "synergy", "paradigm shift")
- Over-promising or sensationalizing

### Content Workflow
1. Research topic thoroughly before scripting
2. Create hook/intro that establishes value upfront
3. Structure with clear sections and timestamps
4. Include practical examples and demonstrations
5. End with clear next steps or call-to-action
